Hey There! This is Saranyan.<!-- laglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglaglag --><p>You can see that, this is how my portfolio would look like.</p>
<p>I got into the Bugbounty and cybersecurity industry after understanding the hacker culture by immersing myself in books and so many courses. I was drawn towards the need to protect data from cybercriminals.It was then that I realized how the perspective of an attacker towards data and information differs from an organization’s perspective. From simulating attacks and assessing risks to implementing defenses to protect a firm’s assets, I couldn’t help but find the idea powerful and imperative to the future. Cybersecurity didn’t just appear to be a stable career choice though, it was fascinating, and I was sure that it’s depth could keep me occupied and interested in years to come. So, to proceed ahead, I chose EC-Council’s Certified Ethical Hacker (C|EH). It is undoubtedly one of the most recognized programs in the industry! Personally, I pursued the C|EH to increase my chances of landing in a well-paying career.</p> <!-- ksjdokhdfgdufdfkjhfkjahdfkjhafkjhakf -->

<p>How a Mechanical Guy went towards Cybersecurity.I chose that field of study because I’ve always been interested in Hacking and coding, and a couple of family members told me it leads to great career options, too. And now I got so many HALL OF FAMES and BOUNTIES from so many Companies. <br><br><br>Give your project links or something like that. <a href="link"> DELL,MASTERCARD,UNILEVER,INDEED,TRIPADVISOR,etc...</a>.</p><!-- hsdgfhjfkdjhfkjsdhfkjdshfkjsdhfkjsdhkfjhdskjfhksdjhfkdsj -->
